Prepare your README
The README.md file in your new repo will serve as the landing page for your project. You can continue to update as your project evolves, but for now, please prepare a basic project outline. I recommend that you review the markdown cheat sheet and use some basic headings, bulleted/numbered lists, and other formatting to organize your outline.

Please include the following (can combine and reorganize as necessary):

Project Title
Name(s) of individual or team members
Short 1-2 sentence summary
Some introductory background information
Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
Tools/packages youâ€™ll use (with links)
Planned methodology/approach
Expected outcomes
Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
References
That may sound like a lot, but some of these items should only be 1-2 sentences, others can be short lists. Consider this the start of your final report.
